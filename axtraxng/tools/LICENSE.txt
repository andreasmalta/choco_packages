7.10	REL staff, agents and representatives have no authority to make any representations, statements, warranties, conditions or agreements that conflict with this License, unless made in writing by a duly authorized officer. Any such unauthorized representations, statements, warranties, conditions or agreements shall not bind REL nor widen REL obligations under this License.

In the case of a breach, if such breach is capable of remedy, REL shall give the Licensee ten days written notice within which to remedy such breach. If, in REL reasonable judgment, such breach is not capable of remedy, termination shall take effect immediately upon the Licensee’s receipt of notice by REL. In the case of non-payment, REL shall give the Licensee ten days written notice within which to make such payment. If the Licensee shall not have remedied a breach that is capable of remedy, or made such payment, whichever the case may be, by the end of such ten day notice period, this License shall be deemed terminated and REL shall have the right to disable the Software, thereby rendering the Software non-functional. REL shall have no liability to the Licensee for terminating the License and disabling the Software pursuant to this clause.

15.0	Entire Agreement
15.1	Any changes or modifications to this License requested by the Licensee shall be valid only if agreed by REL in writing.

15.3	This License, including all schedules, constitutes the entire, and only agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, and communications, whether oral or written, between the parties respecting the subject matter hereof. There are no understandings, agreements, warranties, or representations, express or implied, except as set forth herein. This License prevails over any additional, conflicting, or inconsistent terms and conditions appearing on any purchase order submitted by Licensee.
16.0	Non-Waiver
16.1	If REL delays enforcing an obligation or remedy under this License, such delay shall not result in a waiver or variation of such obligation or remedy. No failure by REL to insist upon strict performance of any term or condition in this License shall constitute a waiver or variation of such term or condition. Such failure shall not prevent REL from claiming a default or seeking a remedy under this License. 
17.0	Invalidity of Clause
17.1	If any provision of this License is determined to be void or unenforceable, the remainder will remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.
17.2	Certain jurisdictions have adopted laws expressly permitting reverse engineering, decoding, decompiling and other uses of the Software prohibited in clause 5. In respect to such jurisdictions, the prohibitions in clause 5 shall be deemed modified but only to the extent necessary to comply with the laws of such jurisdictions.
17.3	Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain implied warranties or the imposition of certain warranty conditions, so the warranty exclusions and conditions in clause 6 may not apply to a Licensee in such jurisdictions. This License does not exclude any warranties or impose any conditions that may not, under applicable law, be excluded or imposed. The warranty in clause 6 gives the Licensee specific legal rights, and does not limit any other legal rights that the Licensee may have under relevant law, except where such relevant law expressly allows such limitations as contained in this License.
17.4	Certain jurisdictions limit the right of a supplier of software to disclaim liability for loss or damage arising from the use of software.

22.5	The Licensee shall grant REL reasonable access to the Licensee’s database, templates, hardware configurations and such other files as REL may reasonably require for the purpose of providing the Maintenance Services. REL shall use its reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Licensee’s information and will execute a non-disclosure agreement if so requested by the Licensee.
22.6	REL may adopt such other procedures as REL deems necessary and appropriate to provide efficient and effective Maintenance Services. These may include satisfaction surveys, fault notification procedures and the maintenance of fault logs. The Licensee agrees to follow any such procedures.
22.7	The Licensee is responsible for installing New Releases. Upon the Licensee’s request, REL shall perform this service at its standard rates and charges, plus travel and accommodation expenses.
22.8	REL is not responsible for faults caused by Third Party Software nor shall REL be required to provide any Maintenance Services in respect to Third Party Software. REL is not responsible for software and hardware incompatibilities.
22.9	REL has a robust Software development program designed to maintain the technical proficiency of the Software for its clients. However, REL does not commit itself to any specific New Release schedule or that it will issue a major upgrade of the Software during the Maintenance Period.
22.10	Pursuant to its Software development program, REL tries to develop functions, features, fixes and updates that will generally benefit its users. However, REL does not warrant that the new functions, features, fixes and updates incorporated within any New Release will be of specific benefit to the Licensee. 
22.11	The Maintenance Services do not include Technical Support in respect to errors caused by: (a) the operation of the Software by the Licensee incorrectly or in a manner other than expressly authorized by REL in its Software documentation, (b) the failure of the Licensee to provide suitably qualified and adequately trained staff for the operation of the Software, (c) a fault in the hardware in which the Software has been installed or (d) a modification, revision, variation, translation or alteration of the Software not authorized by REL, (e) operation of the Software on any hardware platform that is not one of the REL pre-approved computer configuration, or (f) operation of the Software on any hardware or operating system that is not applied exclusively as required for the operation of the Software alone.
22.12	REL shall not be responsible for any failure or delay in providing the Maintenance Services due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control.
22.13	The terms of the License are incorporated herein. The Licensee’s right to receive the Maintenance Services is expressly conditional upon its compliance with the License.
23.0	Maintenance Fees
23.1	REL shall specify the initial Maintenance Fees in its proposal to the Licensee or upon request by the Licensee. The initial Maintenance Fees shall apply for the duration of the initial Maintenance Period. Thereafter, REL may change the Maintenance Fees with effect from the commencement of the next Maintenance Period.
23.2	Where the Maintenance Fees are expressed as percentages of the license fees for the Software, such percentages shall be applied to the then current list price at the commencement of the relevant Maintenance Period for the latest version of the Software.
23.3	The Licensee may not pay Maintenance Fees for only part of the Software licensed from REL or for only a specific number of Software licenses. The Licensee must pay Maintenance Fees for all Software licensed, including all modules thereof. The Licensee must also pay Maintenance Fees on the value of any customizations that REL performed for the Licensee as part of the implementation services since REL will be required to maintain compatibility of those customizations with future New Releases.
23.4	The Licensee shall pay the Maintenance Fees annually in advance. REL shall invoice the Licensee for the Maintenance Fees. The Licensee shall pay such invoice within 30 days of the date of invoice. Maintenance Fees are not refundable.
23.5	If during the Maintenance Period, the Licensee orders additional Software Licenses, or upgrades their system for a higher level License, REL shall invoice the Licensee for the additional Maintenance Fees applicable thereto, prorated to the end of the Maintenance Period. If within 90 days before the end of a Maintenance Period, the Licensee orders additional Software licenses, the Licensee must renew the maintenance on all Software licenses. In such event, the Licensee shall pay the applicable Maintenance Fees for all Software Licenses in respect to the year following the expiration of the then current Maintenance Period and such prorated portion of Maintenance Fees for the additional Software licenses to the end of the then current Maintenance Period.
23.6	If the Licensee does not pay the Maintenance Fees by the due date thereof, the Licensee will not be able to avail itself of the Maintenance Services.
23.7	The Licensee may not reduce the number of Software licenses during a Maintenance Period, except with the prior written consent of REL who may withhold its consent in its sole and absolute discretion.
24.0	Term

Either party may give notice of its intention not to renew at least 90 days before the end of the initial Maintenance Period or 90 days before the anniversary date of any renewal Maintenance Period. If neither party gives such notice, the Maintenance Period shall automatically renew on a year-to-year basis until either party gives such notice at least 90 days before the anniversary date of any renewal Maintenance Period.
24.2	At the end of the final Maintenance Period, all Maintenance Services shall cease. The Licensee will not be able to get New Releases from REL even if REL issues a major New Release shortly thereafter.
25.0	Assignment
To provide efficient and effective Maintenance Services, REL may assign its obligations to provide Maintenance Services or sub-contract some or all of its obligations hereunder.

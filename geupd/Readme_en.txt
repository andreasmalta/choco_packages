       edge of the Overlay will exceed the [Binding Margin] at the time of printing.
       - If the [Binding Margin] is set to 10mm, the leading edge of Overlay will be mobed 
         to 15mm.

 6. Printing in the [Auto Color] Setting

       successfully executed.

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

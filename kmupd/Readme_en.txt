           with the same number of bits is installed, and assign
           the drive (example: C drive) to which Windows is installed in the server
           side as a network drive.
      4-2. When the above-mentioned message comes out at the time of a driver addition,
           Please select [Reference] button and specify the file in which the
           above-mentioned network drive was required.

 5. When you specify the path of the shared printer by [Manual Selection] of Installer, 
    you can not find the printers from [Reference] button in Windows 7 and
